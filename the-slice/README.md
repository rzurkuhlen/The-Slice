A brief description of your project

```
My project is a basic 3 page website for a loacl pizza shop. It features an about section, a specialty section, a menu page, and a contact page.


## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. class name ex( .main-info-section )
.. what class does, ex( adds padding & changes background color of .main-info-section )

2.

```
Most of the css classes I used were for the layout of the page to make everything look even and centered. I didnt change the text color much but did select the body of the page to change the background color. My media queries were used to change the layout of the navigation and footer based on different screen sizes. I also used media queries to change it from a stacked layout in small screens to a three column layout in larger screens


## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. function name ex( animate() )
.. what function does ex( animate() is used to move the elements in the info div across the screen)

```
I used jquery to create a button at the end of the about section which asks for a users email to sign up for a newsletter upon clicking. I then saved the input from the prompt and logged it to the console so it could be saved.
